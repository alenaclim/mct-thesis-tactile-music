# An exploratory study of Emotional Responses to Vibro-tactile Music

## Abstract

The sense of touch in humans is an important component of the way we perceive the world around us. In recent literature, studies focused on the sense of touch from a musical perspective and the possibility to use tactile illusions to convey meaningful musical aspects. The present study explored the emotional response to vibro-tactile music, with potential for enhancing the musical experiences of people suffering from hearing loss. Categorical and continuous models were used to measure emotional response. Several differences were noted between ratings of felt/recognized emotions, hearing and non-hearing participants, musicians and non-musicians. Musical and imaginative associations were also experienced by the participants in most cases. Overall, irrelevant of the intended emotion, nearly all excerpts were considered happy, and a few peaceful, suggesting a bias towards rating vibro-tactile as pleasant, which is consistent with participantsâ€™ opinions. This suggests that vibro-tactile music is successful in conveying emotions and should be explored further.
